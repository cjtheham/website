Early on in my freshman year of college, I was given an assignment to interview a professor and get to know them a bit more. As a part of this interview, we were allowed to write our own questions or use some from a pre-made list. One of the pre-made questions was “If you could require that I read one book before I graduate, what book would it be?”

When I asked this to the professor, he recommended reading *Anthem* by Ayn Rand, and said it was a very eye-opening book for him during his time in university. After I asked for more specifics, he let me know that it was only about 90 pages long and I should just go read it myself. I’ve been meaning to re-build a reading habit and start getting through my list of 300+ books I want to read, so this is a perfect opportunity to start.

I’ll try and keep my reviews fairly short, so I can spend more time reading and less time writing. I also have a very hard time giving a quantifiable rating for books, so this will mostly be thoughts and takeaways rather than writing and storytelling critiques.

### Note: Spoilers for *Anthem* ahead.

Anthem seems to focus on this idea of stifled curiosity, and the things that one can accomplish when they allow their curiosity to run wild. It showcases a dystopian society similar to those in other fiction such as 1984 or The Giver, where knowledge is frowned upon and one is expected to follow orders and nothing else. The protagonist wishes to be hailed a hero, but falls short when the “Council” silences him for his scientific knowledge and findings.

We seem to live in a world where some people believe this is them. In the political and technological world we see people upset that their products and ideas aren’t accepted and are seen as outcasts by society for not creating well enough. However, I think an interpretation of the book’s ending lends credit to this. The protagonist decides to build a society outside of the “normal” world where his scientific and philosophic knowledge is used and appreciated. In the modern world, if your ideas aren’t appreciated it may just be the fact that you aren’t looking in the right market, or that its an ideal you should continue researching and developing on your own before presenting it to others.

Some parts of this book didn’t age very well, and some of it doesn’t flow very well either. The story’s portrayal of romantic relationships in this dystopia feels very misogynistic at times, and very focused on making the protagonist seem like a god-like figure in both his research and relationship. The metaphorical use of “we” instead of “I” throughout the entire writing makes it harder to read.

Overall, this was a solid book but feels a bit outdated and could use some more development. I think this would have been neat if it was developed as a series and focused more on the protagonist, and took an outside narrator instead of a 1st-person view. I don’t regret reading this, and I might even recommend it to some others.

To conclude this, I’d like to share one of the interesting quotes from the book discussing honor and love. These ideas are very prevalent in my life currently, and I found it interesting for the character to bring this up while living in a world based on the collective and not worrying about these values.

> "I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have been born. I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor is a thing to be earned."
