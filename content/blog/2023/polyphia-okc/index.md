Polyphia is one of my favorite bands of all time. Not only do I just think they make amazing music, but Tim Henson's incredible skills is what inspired me to go get my own guitar and start learning more about music (despite me still not being good and not practicing nearly enough...)! I've had the opportunity to see them once before earlier this year, but had another opportunity this year a bit closer to home and jumped at it.

I thought it would be nice to post about this experience here alongside the setlist. There isn't much to say, as it's an experience you have to live. But, I recommend any Polyphia fans go check it out if it comes to your area, and certainly any metal or math rock fans should give the band a listen.
