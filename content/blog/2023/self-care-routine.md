This month, I decided to participate in the IndieWeb Carnival to encourage me to write more blog posts. Coincidentally, this month's prompt, "Self-Care and Routine", is quite applicable to some of the goals I've been working on in my life. Check out the prompt information and original post from Pablo Morales [here](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-october-2023).

Self-care has always seemed to be really tough to define for me, and I have a tendency to focus more on filling up my schedule with responsibilities and tasks rather than focusing on myself and my mental well-being. The past few months, I've been trying to think a lot more about what I can do to promote better mental health and self-care, while getting rid of my awkward feelings when I don't feel productive.

Some examples of things I've been trying to incorporate into my time as a form of self-care include watching more movies for fun, picking up reading again to get some time away from my devices and work, looking into other hobbies I can do that are less "productive-feeling" like cross-stitch, and trying to get more exercise in. I've also been trying to work on my own behaviors, such as spending more time idle in order to feel a bit more comfortable in it, and trying to take on less responsibilities to give me more free time to work on self-care.

Since these are all fairly new routines/activities in my schedule, I haven't really had an opportunity to step back and check-in with myself or take some time to reflect on how I'm feeling with the new self-care systems in place. I am, however, excited to read the other posts for this month and see what others are doing for their self-care and routine and hopefully it might inspire some new routines for me to work. I already enjoyed reading Pablo's initial post, as it made me realize that I'm not alone in finally starting to engage in self-care after years of neglecting it, and his list of routines and behaviors being fairly similar to mine was very encouraging.

Hopefully this post also helped someone, but worst case I got to sit down and write a bit and that's all that matters!
