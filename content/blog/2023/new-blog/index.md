It seems like at least once a year I decide to reboot whatever blog I’m working on, and this is no exception. I hope that with this iteration of `ww0cj.radio`, I can finally decide to stick with a single system until the day that 11ty is no more and I’m forced to switch programs.

Seeing as I haven’t posted here enough in the past, and this is an elevator pitch to get you to subscribe to my RSS feed, I should start by explaining who I am and what you’ll find here.

## Who I Am
My name is CJ, but I also tend to go by the name Rogue online. I’m currently a university student in the USA majoring in Electrical Engineering. I’ve grown up with a fondness for electronics and experimentation, as well as a weird knack for business and finance work. My dream is to spend my life working on radio-adjacent projects, whether continuing as my hobby or making a career out of it.

My current professional life is a bit of a jumble of a lot of different hats, but the one I tend to wear the most while I’m here in university is freelance web developer. I’m neurodivergent and spend a lot of time navigating through various hobbies, and at the moment the ones I’ve spent the most time on are amateur radio, cinema, and foam blasters.

## What I Post
In the past, many of my posts had a focus on creating tangible projects. However, seeing as I leave a lot of projects behind these days, I’d like to make this blog something more content-filled and useful for the future.

Here are some general topics I plan on posting about in the future to get a sense of what this blog is like:
* After-Action Reports for amateur radio events, contests, and activities
* How I adjust my strategies for being productive with ADHD
* My experiences starting up a new student organization at a university
* Exploring the fediverse and the various topics I discuss there
* Book reviews, and my attempts at building up various habits including regular reading
* Video Games as a form of self-care: what games I’m playing and trying to have “unproductive” time
* Updates on dart blaster projects and the [World Foam Alliance](https://worldfoamalliance.org)


## The New Site
I really enjoy working with the JAMstack[^1], and this last site was previously built on the static site generator Hugo. I had even built a custom theme for it that I still use and maintain for other sites, but that’s a later story.

As much as I enjoy working with Hugo, there’s just something about Javascript that I just can’t shake off my past and my knowledge. I’ve moved back to my original site host, 11ty, which has comparable performance to Hugo for this size of a website.

Initially, this site runs off of the default 11ty starter blog template. New features and styling will be added as needed, in the hopes that new features of this blog come as necessary and the site evolves as the number of completed posts continue to increase.

## What about old content?

My last version of `ww0cj.radio` had about 8 posts written out, and as much as that content does still have meaning and relevance to me today I’d like to start this site out with a clean slate. Because of this, I have archived all those old posts personally and will start this site out with this as the first post.

When the time comes, I plan to backfill those posts into the site, but for now I will focus more on creating new content than adapting old posts.

## Creating New Content

Lastly, no blog will ever survive without new content being created. Above, I listed some potential post topics that I’d enjoy writing about in the future. On top of that, I’d also like to adapt old long-form posts from my time on the Fediverse into blog articles. I’d also like to participate in the \#100DaysToOffload challenge, although I’m not sure my class schedules would be very accommodating to that.

I hope this was a decent introduction to myself and my blogging future. If you’d like, this site should have an RSS feed [here](https://ww0cj.radio/feed/feed.xml) that you can subscribe to in your favorite reader. I also try and post on the Fediverse, although my account there is fairly inconsistent. You can find my current primary account in the [About](https://ww0cj.radio/about) page of this site.

[^1]: JAMstack is a web development system that relies on scripts taking templates and markdown languages and turning them into static HTML files for a fast and cheap website. It’s really neat! JAMstack platforms I have used include 11ty, Gatsby, and Hugo. Check them out!
