I was first introduced to this book by way of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Discord Server Book Club, and was intrigued as a current student on any ways I could improve my note-taking. Unfortunately, I don't think the bulk of this book was for me.

SÃ¶nke Ahrens spends most of his writing focused on the joys of Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten system, which is an interesting tactic for note-taking and building up a database of ideas and information. In fact, I have done plenty of research and attempts at starting my own Zettelkasten system. But, this book lacks in the area of describing what makes good and interesting content for notes, that could then become useful for future academic writing, and instead just tells the reader to write.

Writing off-the-cuff isn't inheritly a bad thing, but for building a database of short, interlinked notes I would have preferred a better description of what to write and potentially some examples. Unfortunately, the only examples of "Zettel" notes provided are from Luhmann's own, which Ahrens admits are written in shorthand and hard to decipher the true meaning and context.

Even more so, this book is also very focused on useful techniques for writers in an academic context but even more specifically for researchers. Since I study engineering concepts and general STEM, one of my struggles is understanding how to put those concepts into note form and this book didn't really touch on any types of notes other than those coming from non-fiction and academic literature.

There were, however, a few highlights of Ahrens' tips that I think I'll give a shot in my own note-taking, such as always reading with a pen in hand to jot down ideas, moving away from software for note-taking (or finding a minimalist setup, to stop playing a "game of catch-up" with technology), and focusing on flexibility in writing.

I certainly don't regret reading this, but I probably won't recommend it directly to any of my other STEM-focused friends.
