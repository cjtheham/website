I’ve seen a lot of people on my Fediverse feed posting a monthly summary of content they consumed and stuff they did, and I thought maybe it’d be a good idea for me to do the same! So, here’s my monthly roundup for October 2023!

## Podcasts
I’ve been listening to surprisingly few podcasts these days, considering how much I used to listen to them. Most of my previous podcast listening was done during working hours, but now that I’m back in school it’s a lot harder to find the time. That being said, I did listen to a couple of podcasts so here they are.
- **Ham Radio Workbench** - Specifically, Episode 189 with M0YNG covering Mastodon and the Fediverse for ham radio. I really appreciated this episode because while I didn’t gather too much new information, it is a good resource to know has correct information that I can now pass along to my friends in the hobby. I also listened to half of Episode 193 with W1REX as I love the radio kits he puts out.
- **Ham Radio Crash Course** - The HRCC Podcast is a go-to for me to listen to as basically white noise and get some laughs in at the same time. My information retention isn’t 100% there, so I don’t have much in the way of what I learned to share, but I do really enjoy listening to them when I’m at the gym or folding laundry, or other mindless tasks.

## Books
This month has been great for my reading. I’ve been trying to bring back a reading habit and knock out some books off a To-Be-Read list I’ve been building for years now. This month I read 3 books, which is more than I’ve read in, I think, years.
- **How to Take Smart Notes** by *Sonke Ahrens* - I wrote a [blog post](/blog/2023/how-to-take-smart-notes/) about this but to summarize, I enjoyed the general messages and content but it didn’t really serve much of a resource to me for engineering and STEM note-taking rather than purely academic work.
- **Who Moved My Cheese?** by *Kenneth Blanchard* - I also wrote a [blog post](/blog/2023/who-moved-my-cheese/) about this one, but I really enjoyed the views on change presented in this fashion and plan on recommending it to some friends and family I think could really benefit from it.
- **Packing for Mars** by *Mary Roach* - This book was a great read in terms of both learning and having a good time. It had the vibes of if Randall Munroe did pure writing instead of comic-based humor. I recommend this book for anyone with a mild interest in space, wanting to learn more about space travel without the reading feeling like a drag or too academic or scientific.

## Movies
I don’t write about it much these days on my blog, but I’m a big film nerd. I try to watch a few movies a week when I can, although that’s been dragging behind with school as well.

My thoughts summarized in a sentence or two can always be found on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/roguefoam/), so I won’t put much here except for titles of films watched and my star ratings.
- The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar (2023) - ⭐️⭐️⭐️
- Haunted Mansion (2023) - ⭐️⭐️
- Watchmen (2009) - ⭐️(and a 1/2)
- The Big Short (2015) - ⭐️⭐️⭐️(and a 1/2)
- Five Nights at Freddy’s (2023) - ⭐️⭐️⭐️(and a 1/2)

I realize in writing this I really watched a lot of new releases this month. I guess it will balance out as I plan on diving back in to some older films during my holiday breaks!

This is about all I have had going on this month in terms of content consumption. I plan on spending more time on projects going forward as well, so hopefully future wrap-ups will include more projects worked on and completed work rather than just content but I really enjoyed the stuff I watched, read, and listened to this month and thought it would be worth sharing.

Want to talk about anything I shared here or anything else? Feel free to message me on Fediverse, to the account linked on my [About Me](/about)!
