Playstation Plus is having a ridiculous price increase coming soon. If you don’t pay attention to this stuff, it’s about a 33% increase for US customers and even some more extreme pricing internationally.

I typically only play single-player games, and was considering cancelling my PS Plus subscription anyways due to cost difficulties. At the same time, now that this concern has become wide-spread for others I thought I’d share some of my concerns with this price change and the mass cancellation of subscriptions that is probably coming from this.

To start, I’ve spent the past 3 years claiming all the games that come up free with my subscription and that I find interesting. I’ve got close to 100 individual games in my library that were monthly claims. Once you cancel your subscription you lose the license to that game, and can’t play it. But, on top of that, the Playstation Store system causes some difficulties here. Say I canceled my subscription, but decided I wanted to play the Crash Bandicoot trilogy which I have claimed on my PS Plus subscription. My options to play it would be to either renew my subscription and play it, or sit on chat with support for an hour to get them to cancel my license to that game so I am able to purchase the game normally. Not even a disc copy would work so long as the PS Plus version is on my account without an active subscription.

Then comes the issue of multiplayer games. Like I said, I typically only play single-player games but there is a random occasion where I’d like to play multi-player. For instance, the newly released Baldur’s Gate III is popular amongst my friends and I wanted to try and play a campaign co-op with some friends that also play it on PS5. If I decide to cancel my subscription when it renews, that gives me 3 months from today to play any multiplayer games I want before I lose that access.

Subscription culture gives companies too much power to take away access in a heartbeat to owned content just because they feel like it. In this case, they realized they can charge more money and simply did without accommodating for those who find themselves unable to afford it with the price increase. This worries me for my gaming future, as I’ve been trying to play games more often as a form of self-care and relaxation. We shall see where this goes, but it is a troublesome development.
