I've always been someone who has a tendency to resist change. I like my set schedules and predictability, and knowing exactly what is waiting for me ahead. However, I do realize some change is necessary in my life, and I try hard to fight that urge to sit in the predictability that might be bringing me down and move towards change.

*Who Moved My Cheese?* is a book written by Dr. Spencer Johnson which tells a sort of parable about 4 characters finding their own way through change. Each one has their own way of tackling the problem of change, but some are certainly better than others. There's those who quickly adapt to change, those who adapted over time, and those who resist the change till the last possible second.

Since this book is so short (I was able to read it in only a couple of hours!), I recommend you read it yourself so I don't spoil anything. However, I'd take some time to think about what your "Cheese" is and what changes you're making to accomodate your current goals.

For instance, this book helped me realize that my "Cheese" is both my academic future and graduation as well as self-growth. I've been struggling a bit with academics lately, so this book made me think a bit harder about what tactics I'm sticking with and the change I'm resisting that might help me move forward towards these goals a bit easier. As an example, I realized that my study tactics may not be as helpful as I think they are and that it may finally be time to try other study plans that I have read about.

Give this book a shot if you're like me and struggle with change, and I'd love to hear your thoughts! Shoot me a toot over on the Fediverse (see [About Me](/about)) with your thoughts if you read it!
