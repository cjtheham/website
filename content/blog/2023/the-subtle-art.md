I’m trying to move away from long write-ups about books, for the sole fact that I mostly just say go read it yourself. However, I decided I felt the need to write about this book for good reason, so here we are.

TSAoNGAF, along with having the longest acronym, is one of the most commonly recommended self-help books I see today outside of some other major players like Atomic Habits. The book can be seen on tons of bestseller lists, front and center in bookstores, and on plenty of internet lists. I personally think its because of the swearing that’s prominently displayed, it seems to catch people off-guard and that out-of-the-norm style brings them in and makes them want to read it.

So, as expected, this book has been on my to-be-read list for a while now. In fact, it was the first book I apparently added when I moved my list over to its current location (Storygraph). But, this book was honestly disappointing to me.

Don’t get me wrong, I back the core message of what Manson is preaching here. We live in a world today where we are consumed by not only outside forces like social media but also strong internal emotions, all trying to grab at our attention and pull us away. We can only really focus on the things that matter when we can find it in ourselves to pull away from everything drawing us in, and start putting our care and energy into what we truly *want* to care about.

Manson puts a lot of pressure on the individual here, which really rubbed me the wrong way. He seems to try and pin all of this care and attention being misguided not on the circumstances of the modern world but rather on a sense of entitlement in everyone. I feel bad for the readers who took this to heart, and immediately began seeing themselves as entitled rather than understanding the bigger picture of what is causing the negatives in their life. He also makes some comments about mental health that seemed very dismissive to myself, but I haven’t seen many others complain about that so I’ll leave it to that comment.

Of course, you can’t expect much from a book that gets all its attention and praise and stands out from the crowd by simply using swear words more than the average author. But, I think there are a lot better self-help books one can read that will make you feel better and that you can gain more out of than this. For some recommendations, I really enjoy Ryan Holiday as an author, and specifically his book *The Obstacle is The Way* which in a way mimics the approaches suggested by Manson but with more of a focus on stoicism and pushing past obstacles rather than ignoring them.
